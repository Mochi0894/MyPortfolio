       <p>My name is Angel Crook! I'm an 11th grader at CASA. Here is my portfolio! <br> 
         I wish to do projects in the future for brands, companies, authors, shows, and games :)</p>
         <h2>Here's some examples of my work ( all these were done in my freshmen year, <br> to see my other works, use the links above! ) </h2>


<p>    <b> Magazine Project :</b>
Here we see, a fake magazine cover I made for my cat! The Colors are blue and brown, my pet cat socks is displayed on the cover,<br>
Her name is socks because her back paws look like white socks that go up to her knees. How cute!

I used adobe photoshop</p>
<p>     <b>Prom Ticket Project</b>
Here we see, a prom ticket I made! I tried to incorporate a grandiose theme to match. This ticket won the contest, and 150+ copies were printed.
I used adobe photoshop.</p>
<p>    <b> Editing Project </b>
Here we see, a heavily edited picture of lain! from serial experiments lain. The anime is about the side affects of being addicted to the internet,<br>
 so I wanted to give the image a glitch-looking cyber effect.
I used adobe photoshop.</p>
<p>    <b>Name Letter Project : </b> 
Here we see, My name! each letter of my name has a picture that I think represent me, a 2000's background to show my love for 2000's graphics,<br>
Mochi, because my username online is often mochi.
Strawberries, because their my favorite fruit!
Hatsune Miku, because I own a lot of merch of her :)

I used adobe photoshop.</p>
