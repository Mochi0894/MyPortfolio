    The player character: also unnamed, It's the character you play as. 
    The story of the game is that this player character has a terrible 
    Gashapon addiction and has to collect all of them. So they search, 
    and come across this town. This town has a gashapon shop, so they 
    collect coins around town to use to collect little keychains.

    In-game Screenshots: I wanted my game to give off a "retro Pokémon" 
    type feel, something that would be made in RPG maker (a game making software). 
    Unfortunately I haven't been able to capture the atmosphere I wanted.

<!-- ✅ NPC BOX -->
<div class="box clearfix">
  <div class="text">
    NPCs: The planned NPCs for the video game. Unfortunately due to time 
    constraints they were never added. These NPCs would be interactable with 
    their own dialogue and purpose. They don't actually have names, they are 
    referred to as their occupation.
